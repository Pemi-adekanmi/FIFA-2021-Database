FIFA 21 is a football simulation video game published by Electronic Arts as part of the FIFA series. It is the 28th installment in the FIFA series and was released on 9 October 2020 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

This database was created on postgresql 13 with pgAdmin 4. It has only one table which contains the records and information of each football players in the video game with 17981 rows and 9 columns. I extracted the script for this database from the query editor and converted it to a PDF file.
